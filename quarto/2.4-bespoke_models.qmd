## The Rainbow

Although this chapter is about creating bespoke models... we should mention all the generic statistical and machine learning models that may meet your needs.

We are gradually making more 'bespoke' models... There tend to be common types of models because they can be applied so generally, these include the generalized linear models and other 'machine learning' types of models like decision trees. However, there's nothing in statistics that limits us to just these... If we have a specialized case, like modeling the motion of a spring, we can generate a specialized model.

Refer to statistical learning for more...
