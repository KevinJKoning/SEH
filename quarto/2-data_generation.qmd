In the first half of the book, 

Select a subchapter from the left hand menu...

There are two recommended ways to work your way through this primer.
A) Just go in top down order, this will introduce you first to the probability of data given a model of a data generating process, and it will work into models of greater and greater complexity.
B) Do the first chapter in *probability of data*, then do the first chapter of *probability of model*, then the second chapter in both, etc. This bounces between the probability of the data and the likelihood of the model.

## Notes to self

NEED TO BETTER USE REFERENCE TO PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS AND NAMED PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS

## Data Generation Processes TEMPORARY OUTLINE

THEMES:

- Obviously the loop of P(D|M) and P(M|D)
- Computation instead of analysis

DIFFICULTIES:

- It's elegant to introduce probability distributions, linear models, etc... as all models of data generating processes.
- We emphasis data generation and models over analytical probability distributions because nothing in real life actually follows the probability distributions
- However, where po

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE A SPECIAL SUBSET OF MODELS IN WHICH IT'S SIMPLE TO COMPUTE THE PROBABILITY GIVEN ONLY THE PARAMETERS. OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO GENERATE AN ENTIER DATA SET.


## Note to self

Models of wave heights could be a cool one.


## More academic way to talk about probability distribution

More abstractly, a probability distribution emerges whenever:
	•	There is uncertainty in an outcome.
	•	There is a set of possible outcomes (sample space).
	•	A rule or process assigns probabilities to those outcomes.



How Do Probability Distributions Emerge?

Probability distributions don’t exist in isolation—they arise from the structure of real-world processes. The shape of a distribution is governed by the mechanisms generating the data.

Here are a few fundamental principles that give rise to different distributions:

A. Repeated Independent Events → Binomial & Normal Distributions
	•	If an event occurs with some probability  p  and is repeated  n  times (e.g., flipping a coin), the Binomial Distribution models the number of successes.
	•	If the number of events grows large, the sum/average of many independent variables tends to a Normal (Gaussian) Distribution, thanks to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).



Are Probability Distributions Real or Just Models?

Distributions don’t exist in nature; they are models of uncertainty. Reality is messy, but distributions help us:
	•	Make predictions based on limited data.
	•	Quantify uncertainty in decision-making.
	•	Optimize processes (finance, physics, AI, etc.).

Example: Why is the Normal Distribution So Common?

Because many real-world variables are the sum of many tiny independent effects. This follows from the Central Limit Theorem, which says that sums or averages of many small, independent variations tend toward a Normal distribution.
