In the first half of the book, 

Select a subchapter from the left hand menu...

There are two recommended ways to work your way through this primer.
A) Just go in top down order, this will introduce you first to the probability of data given a model of a data generating process, and it will work into models of greater and greater complexity.
B) Do the first chapter in *probability of data*, then do the first chapter of *probability of model*, then the second chapter in both, etc. This bounces between the probability of the data and the likelihood of the model.

TODO: **BOLD** words that end up in a glossary
TODO: NEED TO CLEAN UP USE OF LIKELIHOOD AND PROBABILITY - PROBABILITY GOING FORWARD, LIKELIHOOD GOING BACKWARD
TODO: Need to only have data generation in the first normal likelihood app, MLE and changing the data generating distribution in the second.
TODO: APP FOR DIFFERENT PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS, MAKE IT ITS OWN SUBCHAPTER?

## Data Generation Processes TEMPORARY OUTLINE

### Dice Rolls
- Create the data generating process
- It's easy to find the likelihood/probability of the outcomes
- Note how large number of dice is looking a lot like a normal/gaussian distribution

### Normal and Other Distributions

- Each distribution has assumptions about the data generating process
    - Normal assumes many additive processes
    - Lognormal assumes many multiplicative processes
- Are idealized real process, but the tradeoff is simplicity of description with only a few parameters

### Histograms and Likelihood

- Histogams can help us approximate likelihood of continuous data
    - Or we can understand probability density and cumulative distributions
- Include log likelihood and the need for indepedence (not a time series)
- Importance of statistical assumptions



## Other Notes

Data Generation
- Dice Rolls
- Probability Distributions for Data Generation
- Linear Regression

Parameter Estimation
- Dice Rolls (guess and check app)
- Probability Distribution (enhanced normal app with MLE and adjustment of data generation)
- Linear Regression (both frequentist with underlying assumption and bayesian)

Conclusion.
