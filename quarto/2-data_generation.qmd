In the first half of the book, 

Select a subchapter from the left hand menu...

There are two recommended ways to work your way through this primer.
A) Just go in top down order, this will introduce you first to the probability of data given a model of a data generating process, and it will work into models of greater and greater complexity.
B) Do the first chapter in *probability of data*, then do the first chapter of *probability of model*, then the second chapter in both, etc. This bounces between the probability of the data and the likelihood of the model.

## Data Generation Processes TEMPORARY OUTLINE

THEMES:

- Obviously the loop of P(D|M) and P(M|D)
- Computation instead of analysis

DIFFICULTIES:

- It's elegant to introduce probability distributions, linear models, etc... as all models of data generating processes.
- We emphasis data generation and models over analytical probability distributions because nothing in real life actually follows the probability distributions
- However, where po

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS ARE A SPECIAL SUBSET OF MODELS IN WHICH IT'S SIMPLE TO COMPUTE THE PROBABILITY GIVEN ONLY THE PARAMETERS. OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO GENERATE AN ENTIER DATA SET.
