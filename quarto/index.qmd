There are plenty of texts written by academic statisticians that take a deep mathematical perspective on statistics. Having been introduced to statistics that way, I fear many if not most readers will miss the key concepts that form the foundation of statistics.

This 'primer' is an attempt to create the right intuitions without diving too deeply into the math. An engineer already has many of the technical skills needed to do useful statistical analysis, and the hope is that the right foundation of statistical concepts allows them to view problems when needed from the right statistical and probabilistic perspective.
