If you are interested in the many statistical/machine learning tools, I suggest you refer to *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani.\n",

        "\n",
        "That was not a typo. The advantage is both in the speed in which you can perform an analysis as well as the simplicity in communicating how you performed the analysis. I say it is a disadvantage because you are not forced to think through your problem, especially the assumptions that each tool is making. For example, in linear regression, you have a implicit prior assumption that the error term is constant and normally distributed.\n",

        "Statistical models that have too much flexibility can be optimized into all sorts of nonsensical solutions. Allowing a negative intercept in a linear regression model of the diamond dataset is one example, as it indicates customers will be paid to take small diamonds. I like to visualize this as a truss with beams/members that can contort into all sorts of nonsensical shapes. What we really want are beams/members that bend in reasonable ways.\n",

        "We can use our knowledge of the data generating process to create reasonable **priors** for our model. This is simply saying that we already know some reasonable range of values, or even a most likely value, for the parameters of the model. Common examples are not letting a parameter take a negative value, or that previous experience suggest the parameter is near a certain value. Setting a prior does not mean we force a parameter value on the model, it just eliminates the impossible values and nudges the model towards our prior knowledge. If the data is different..."
