## Intro/Overview

At its heart, I believe statistics is a looping process with only two steps:
A) Describing the likelihood of data from a 'known' data generating process.
B) Using data to estimate the likelihood of the parameters and form of a data generating process.

The process can start with A) or B). To really drive it home the process is summarized in @fig-process below.

```{mermaid}
//| label: fig-process
//| fig-cap: "Statistical Process"

%%{init: {'theme':'neutral'}}%%
graph TB
    A["Data Generation"] -->|Likelihood \n of Data| B["Data"]
    B -->|Likelihood of \n Data Generation| A
```

For convenience, we'll start *assuming* that we know the process generating the data we examine. In reality we usually have only clues. Regardless, starting here allows us to quickly examine the core concept of probability/likelihood. Once we have a good understanding of probability/likelihood, it will allow us to work in 'reverse' and to use the data to estimate the properties/parameters of the data generating process.
