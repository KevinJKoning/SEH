## Data Generation Processes TEMPORARY OUTLINE

### Dice Rolls
- Create the data generating process
- It's easy to find the likelihood/probability of the outcomes
- Note how large number of dice is looking a lot like a normal/gaussian distribution

### Normal and Other Distributions

- Each distribution has assumptions about the data generating process
    - Normal assumes many additive processes
    - Lognormal assumes many multiplicative processes
- Are idealized real process, but the tradeoff is simplicity of description with only a few parameters

### Histograms and Likelihood

- Histogams can help us approximate likelihood of continuous data
    - Or we can understand probability density and cumulative distributions
- Include log likelihood and the need for indepedence (not a time series)
- Importance of statistical assumptions
